# RAG_System_Techniques

## Retriever + Augmented + Generation (RAG):
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of generative models by incorporating relevant external information retrieved from a large corpus. This approach leverages the strengths of both retrieval and generation to provide more informed and contextually appropriate outputs.
